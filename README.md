## Installation
Clone the application from GitHub, run NPM install from the root of redux-shop, the run npm start to run the server.

## Usage
You must sign up and be logged in to be able to access the care.  Once you are logged in, you can add items to the cart.  When you are ready to checkout, click checkout in the cart and you will be taken to Stripe's credit card payment window.  Enter your information except for the credit card number, where you will type in "4242 4242 4242 4242" with an expiration of "1/44" and a CVC of "123".  At this point you may submit the order and it will transfer you back to a success screen.
